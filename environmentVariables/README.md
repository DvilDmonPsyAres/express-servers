<!-- If you're working on a team, you'll need a way to document what the contents of the .env should look like. One approach is to update the project's README.md file with instructions on what environment variables need to be defined in the .env file. Another option is to add an .env.example file to your project that mirrors the contents of the .env file but replaces any sensitive information with dummy values: -->

PORT=PORT_VALUE_HERE
SECRET=SECRET_HERE
NODE_ENV=ENV_TYPE_HERE
